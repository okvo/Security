Vulnerability Description: Privilege Persistence After Role Downgrade
Vulnerability ID: [Unique ID or Reference Number]
Severity: High
Affected Systems: [Application Name/Version, Web Server, etc.]

Summary:
The web application under assessment exhibits a vulnerability where a user's privileges persist at a higher level after an administrative role downgrade, until the user logs out and back in. This issue arises because the user's session is not immediately updated to reflect the change in their role, allowing them to retain access to functions and resources that should no longer be available to them.

Description:
When an administrator changes a user's role from a high-privilege level (e.g., administrator) to a low-privilege level (e.g., standard user), the application fails to immediately enforce the updated role within the user's active session. As a result, the user retains their original high-privilege access until they manually log out and back in.

This vulnerability can be exploited by a user who is aware of their role downgrade. By avoiding a logout, the user can continue to perform unauthorized actions that are only permissible under the high-privilege role, such as accessing sensitive data, modifying critical settings, or performing administrative functions.

Impact:
Unauthorized Access: Users can access, modify, or delete sensitive information or configurations that should be restricted based on their new, lower-privilege role.
Potential for Data Breach: High-privilege actions, if misused, could lead to data breaches or other security incidents.
Inconsistent Security Posture: The application's access control model becomes unreliable, potentially leading to further security risks.
Reproduction Steps:
Log in as a user with a high-privilege role.
Have an administrator change the user's role to a low-privilege role.
Without logging out, attempt to access or perform actions restricted to the high-privilege role.
Observe that the user can still perform actions that should no longer be allowed under their downgraded role.
Recommended Remediation:
Immediate Session Update: Implement logic to immediately update the user's session data when their role is changed. This can be done by either forcing a session refresh or by dynamically adjusting the session attributes in real-time.
Session Invalidation: Upon role downgrade, automatically invalidate the current session and require the user to log in again. This ensures that the new, correct role is enforced.
Access Control Verification: Ensure that role-based access control checks are performed at the point of action to verify the user's current role, not just their session data.
